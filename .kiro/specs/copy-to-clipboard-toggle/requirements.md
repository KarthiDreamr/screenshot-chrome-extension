# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a copy to clipboard toggle option to the Full Screenshot Selector extension, allowing users to choose whether captured screenshots should be automatically copied to the clipboard in addition to being downloaded as files. This provides users with more flexibility in how they handle their screenshots, enabling quick pasting into other applications without needing to locate and open the downloaded file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the screenshot extension, I want to toggle whether screenshots are copied to clipboard, so that I can quickly paste them into other applications without downloading files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup is opened THEN the system SHALL display a toggle control for "Copy to Clipboard"
2. WHEN the user toggles the copy to clipboard option THEN the system SHALL save this preference to browser storage
3. WHEN the extension is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previously saved copy to clipboard preference
4. WHEN a screenshot is captured AND copy to clipboard is enabled THEN the system SHALL copy the image data to the clipboard
5. WHEN a screenshot is captured AND copy to clipboard is enabled THEN the system SHALL still download the file as before (both actions occur)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the copy to clipboard feature to work reliably across different browsers, so that I can depend on this functionality regardless of my browser choice.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about the copy to clipboard feature, so that I understand when it's enabled and when clipboard operations succeed or fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the copy to clipboard toggle is enabled THEN the system SHALL display visual indication of the enabled state
2. WHEN a screenshot is captured with clipboard copying enabled THEN the system SHALL show a success message indicating both download and clipboard copy
3. WHEN clipboard copying fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message while still confirming the download succeeded
4. WHEN hovering over the copy to clipboard toggle THEN the system SHALL display helpful tooltip text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the copy to clipboard feature to handle different image formats appropriately, so that the clipboard content works well with various applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN copying to clipboard THEN the system SHALL preserve the same image quality as the downloaded file
3. WHEN copying to clipboard THEN the system SHALL handle transparency settings according to the background preference
